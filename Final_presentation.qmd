## What's the point of it all

- Same as everyone else
    - get the smallest RMSE



- But what does that even mean in this context?
  - Answer: have a model who is off by the lowest amount when predicting profit


## Scrub-a-dub-dub (AKA Cleaning the Data)

- A lot of percentages in this data
  - meaning that a lot of numeric data was being seen as textual, making any meaningful feature building next to impossible
  
- So we chopped off the percentages!
  - Yay! Workable data!

## Features We Used {.smaller}

   - bel_avg_BOM
   - high_revenue 
   - log_revenue 
   - interaction_cost_units 
   - high_volume 
   - src_www 
   - direct 
   - form 
   - finish 
   - year_min 

## A detailed look: bel_94_perc_BOM
- Stands for 'Below the 94th Percentile BOM (Bill of Materials)'
- Bill of Materials:
  - explanation here
- Why the 94th percentile?
